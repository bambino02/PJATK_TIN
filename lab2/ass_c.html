    <h1>How the Pandemic Is Affecting Women in Tech</h1>
    <p> The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated gender equality issues, and women in tech roles are often those suffering
        most. Here is a look at some of the most pressing problems and what needs to change.</p>
    <h2>The Pandemic Worsened Womens Burdens</h2>
    <p>Working from home might seem like a dream come true for women in tech, and indeed, throughout all industries.
        After all, remote work allows them to do away with long, stressful commutes, and it may free them up from the
        time they had ordinarily spend applying makeup, choosing outfits or otherwise making efforts to appear more
        presentable in public.

        However, researchers from the University of Pennsylvania found that women often had to continue their housework
        and child care responsibilities during the pandemic as they engaged in remote work. More specifically, females
        were more than twice as likely to bear the primary responsibility for those duties, even when their partners
        worked from home, too.
        The gender imbalance was even more dramatic in heterosexual couples when the woman worked remotely, and her male
        partner worked outside the home. In such cases, the man often reported that the housework and child-raising
        duties he did were less than before.

        The pandemic was not the beginning of this unequal distribution of work. However, it made it more severe in many
        cases. One significant reason was that so many schools switched to remote learning options, and child care
        facilities closed temporarily. Then, women who may have had a relatively quiet house while their kids were at
        school or daycare had to manage differently after those options no longer existed.

        Research shows that remote workers are often happier and more productive than their in-office counterparts.
        However, the reality often depends on how well a persons home facilitates achieving consistent focus with few
        distractions.
        Plus, if a woman feels constantly preoccupied about all the housework and family responsibilities that await her
        after she goes off the clock, it will understandably be hard to concentrate.</p>
    <h2>Women May Feel Compelled To Assess Job Options</h2>
    <p>Many women found that it was unsustainable to remain in their jobs during the pandemic. Sometimes that happened
        when employers did not take the pandemic seriously and required people to keep working in offices, putting
        employees or vulnerable household members at an elevated risk.

        Additionally, a study of women in tech found they were nearly twice as likely as men to have lost their jobs or
        been furloughed during COVID-19. The pandemic has caused many people to reassess what is most important in their
        lives and take stock of what is not working well. When women find themselves facing a resume gap or eyeing a
        return to the workforce after taking a break due to COVID-19, childbirth or another reason, appealing options
        exist for them. </p>
    <h2>Pursuing Relaunch and Return-to-Work Programs</h2>
    <p>Wells Fargo has a Glide â€” Relaunch program for professionals who want to resume their careers after a life event.
        Similarly, IBMs Tech Re-Entry Program offers a paid returnship program that could result in full-time
        employment. There is also the STEM Reentry Task Force, geared towards females in technology and engineering roles
        that are ready to resume their careers.</p>
    <h2>Addressing Resume Gaps</h2>
    <p>If questions come up during an interview about why a woman has a career history gap, the language used to respond
        can turn that reality into an advantage. Additionally, maybe she got laid off during the pandemic and used the
        time to learn a new coding language or enroll in an online course relevant to her career path.</p>
    <h2>Considering Remote Jobs Based in Other Cities or Countries</h2>
    <p>One positive of the pandemic that many people can agree on is that it made employers realize the potential of
        remote work. Even though working remotely can increase the stresses that women deal with daily, that is not
        always the case.

        During COVID-19, some people became fed up with the high rent, congestion and other issues associated with large
        cities and decided to move elsewhere. One study found that 56% of U.S. households plan to move in 2021. The
        beauty of remote work is that women in tech can expand their searches to other cities or countries if appealing
        tech roles dont exist near them.

    </p>
    <h2>Females in Tech Likely To Experience Burnout</h2>
    <p>The first annual Girls in Tech survey assessed how the pandemic affected women in the industry. One finding was
        that 79% of working moms reported feeling burned out. Another conclusion was that the outcome was more likely to
        occur when women had male supervisors. In such cases, burnout happened 63% of the time versus 44% of instances
        with female bosses.

        Another startling finding was that burnout among females in tech is much more likely when a companies
        highest-ranking executive is a man. 85% of respondents reported such incidents versus only 15% feeling burned
        out when the top leader was a woman.

        COVID-19 may have exacerbated burnout likelihood, particularly if women had new worries related to becoming ill
        or caring for sick loved ones. However, burnout in tech is not a new issue, nor is it a female-exclusive
        problem.

        A 2018 study conducted by Blind showed that more than 57% of tech sector workers felt burned out. When
        researchers asked respondents about the causes, they cited issues with excessive workload, a toxic culture, a
        lack of control and insufficient career growth opportunities among the matters at hand.

    </p>
    <h2>Strategies for Change</h2>
    <p>Helping women in tech target these pressing issues will not be easy. Moreover, some changes must occur within
        personal and familial relationships to have the most beneficial effects. For example, an employer might offer to
        let a woman conduct most of her workday during off-hours once her toddlers have gone to bed. Another strategy
        could be to let her tackle her most mentally strenuous tasks during a childs naptime or out-of-the-home
        playdate.

        Those things help, but it is even more advantageous if the males in that persons life and household recognizes
        the extra strain caused by managing household responsibilities, child care and professional work all at once,
        and can try to relieve some of it.

        It is also positive that a growing number of companies offer programs to help women restart their careers.
        Another step in the right direction would occur if employers were more understanding that stepping into a
        caregiving role or having a baby may shift a persons priorities, but does not make them incapable of work or any
        less talented. For example, agreeing to let a woman work part-time while addressing other necessities in her
        life prevents resume gaps.Getting to the heart of the burnout issue varies depending on an organizations most
        prevalent contributors to the problem. Are late-night app launch sessions or website updates mostly to blame?
        Perhaps workers feel that supervisors do not recognize their achievements, making them feel exhausted with little
        to show for it.In any case, getting worker feedback is the first step in solving any problem, whether it mostly
        affects women or everyone. Then, decision-makers can confirm where the biggest issues lie and discuss how to
        mitigate them.
    </p>
    <h3>No Simple Solutions</h3>
    <p>Solving these issues and making the workforce more gender-balanced is not straightforward. However, committing to
        addressing the problem is necessary to improve it and make the workplace more attractive to everyone.</p>
