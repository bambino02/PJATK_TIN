        <p>Years ago, we started calling it fashion month, not Fashion Week, and now it’s more like fashion months, plural. Truthfully, it’s always Fashion Week somewhere. Just days after the spring 2022 shows wrapped in Paris, hundreds of designers are gearing up for Shanghai’s second IRL, post-pandemic Fashion Week. From the main venue in Xintiandi to Labelhood’s buzzy emerging-designer platform, the week will be busier than anything we’ve seen in New York or Europe yet. Dave Tacon is on the ground covering all of the best street style between the shows; scroll through his latest coverage here.</p>

          Adele on the Other Side
        </h1>
        <p>
          On my way to Heart & Hustle, a private gym in West Hollywood, where I will be joining Adele for her Monday morning workout, I get the distinct feeling that the Queen of Hearts is about to put me through my paces.
          It’s inevitable to some degree. Adele has been doing rigorous weight-lifting and circuit-training sessions every day—twice a day if her anxiety is running high—for three years and counting. It is also true that if, say, the whole world went nuts at the first sight of your significant weight loss, and aired a lot of uninformed theories and loud opinions about your significant weight loss, one way to set the record straight and reclaim the narrative would be to put a journalist to absolute shame at your gym.
          When she arrives, breezing through the back door in head-to-toe spandex, my fate is clear. Adele is not merely fit. She’s a brick house, with the kind of muscle definition that’s visible through leggings. Heart & Hustle is a no-frills establishment, owned by two guys from New York and Philly—the back entrance was designed to resemble something from Goodfellas—and one of them, Gregg Miele, is here to lead our workout. Within minutes, Adele is going to town on an elliptical, and I’m just a few feet away, swishing around on another machine, already short of breath.

          She starts peppering me with questions, cutting to the quick in that uniquely disarming way that compels you to do the same. When this is sustained for any period of time, it results in a turbo-speed confessional that can only be conveyed with a timeline.

Two minutes and 50 seconds in: Adele mentions that she has a bad back. I tell her that I have two slipped discs. We establish that she has the same slipped discs (L5 and L6).

Three and a half minutes in: While going hard on the elliptical, Adele remarks, “I’m always a bit hungover on Monday morning.” Lockdown turned me into a seven-nights-a-week wine drinker, I tell her. She nods and says: “It got earlier and earlier, the drinking.”

Six minutes in: Adele says that she has probably spent more time with Miele in the last three years than anyone else. “All these other people have come out saying that they trained me,” she says. “Fuckin’ weirdos. I’ve never met them in my life!”

Nine and a half minutes in: I ask if COVID took an emotional toll. Adele responds that much of the emotional stuff her friends went through, she’d gone through the year before, in the middle of her divorce. (Adele was married to the charity executive Simon Konecki for two years. They have a nine-year-old son, Angelo.) “Everyone had to face a lot of their demons, because they had so much time on their hands with nothing to distract them,” she says. “They had to face themselves in isolation. Whereas I did that the year before.”

Eleven minutes in: Back on the subject of alcohol and lockdown. “My first emergency run at the grocery store was for Whispering Angel and ketchup,” Adele says, referring to her favorite rosé. “Whispering Angel turned me into a barking dog. It did not make me whisper.”

Twelve minutes in: I tell her that when lockdown lifted, I felt like an Edie emerging from Grey Gardens. “I got some of the worst ingrown hairs I’ve ever had in my life,” she replies.

It goes on like this for an hour, as Adele proceeds through every weight machine and I wilt in the manner of someone who hasn’t seen the inside of a gym since 2016. She spent many pandemic days and nights here, working out while a movie played on the TV. The Rocky series was a favorite, which may partially account for the boxing gloves she’s hung on a wall nearby. (One says FUCK, the other ORF.)
