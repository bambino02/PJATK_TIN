  <p>Years ago, we started calling it fashion month, not Fashion Week, and now it ss more like fashion months, plural.
    Truthfully, it is always Fashion Week somewhere. Just days after the spring 2022 shows wrapped in Paris, hundreds of
    designers are gearing up for Shanghais second IRL, post-pandemic Fashion Week. From the main venue in Xintiandi to
    Labelhoods buzzy emerging-designer platform, the week will be busier than anything we have seen in New York or
    Europe
    yet. Dave Tacon is on the ground covering all of the best street style between the shows; scroll through his latest
    coverage here.</p>

  <h1>
    Adele on the Other Side
  </h1>
  <p>
    On my way to Heart and Hustle, a private gym in West Hollywood, where I will be joining Adele for her Monday morning
    workout, I get the distinct feeling that the Queen of Hearts is about to put me through my paces.
    It is inevitable to some degree. Adele has been doing rigorous weight-lifting and circuit-training sessions every
    day—twice a day if her anxiety is running high—for three years and counting. It is also true that if, say, the whole
    world went nuts at the first sight of your significant weight loss, and aired a lot of uninformed theories and loud
    opinions about your significant weight loss, one way to set the record straight and reclaim the narrative would be
    to put a journalist to absolute shame at your gym.
    When she arrives, breezing through the back door in head-to-toe spandex, my fate is clear. Adele is not merely fit.
    She is a brick house, with the kind of muscle definition that is visible through leggings. Heart and Hustle is a
    no-frills establishment, owned by two guys from New York and Philly—the back entrance was designed to resemble
    something from Goodfellas—and one of them, Gregg Miele, is here to lead our workout. Within minutes, Adele is going
    to town on an elliptical, and I am just a few feet away, swishing around on another machine, already short of
    breath.

    She starts peppering me with questions, cutting to the quick in that uniquely disarming way that compels you to do
    the same. When this is sustained for any period of time, it results in a turbo-speed confessional that can only be
    conveyed with a timeline.

    Two minutes and 50 seconds in: Adele mentions that she has a bad back. I tell her that I have two slipped discs. We
    establish that she has the same slipped discs (L5 and L6).

    Three and a half minutes in: While going hard on the elliptical, Adele remarks, ''I am always a bit hungover on
    Monday
    morning.'' Lockdown turned me into a seven-nights-a-week wine drinker, I tell her. She nods and says: ''It got
    earlier
    and earlier, the drinking.''

    Six minutes in: Adele says that she has probably spent more time with Miele in the last three years than anyone
    else. ''All these other people have come out saying that they trained me, '' she says. ''Fuckin weirdos. I have
    never met
    them in my life!''

    Nine and a half minutes in: I ask if COVID took an emotional toll. Adele responds that much of the emotional stuff
    her friends went through, she had gone through the year before, in the middle of her divorce. (Adele was married to
    the charity executive Simon Konecki for two years. They have a nine-year-old son, Angelo.) ''Everyone had to face a
    lot of their demons, because they had so much time on their hands with nothing to distract them, '' she says. ''They
    had to face themselves in isolation. Whereas I did that the year before.''

    Eleven minutes in: Back on the subject of alcohol and lockdown. ''My first emergency run at the grocery store was
    for
    Whispering Angel and ketchup, '' Adele says, referring to her favorite rose. ''Whispering Angel turned me into a
    barking dog. It did not make me whisper.''

    Twelve minutes in: I tell her that when lockdown lifted, I felt like an Edie emerging from Grey Gardens. ''I got
    some
    of the worst ingrown hairs I have ever had in my life,'' she replies.

    It goes on like this for an hour, as Adele proceeds through every weight machine and I wilt in the manner of someone
    who has not seen the inside of a gym since 2016. She spent many pandemic days and nights here, working out while a
    movie played on the TV. The Rocky series was a favorite, which may partially account for the boxing gloves she is
    hung on a wall nearby. (One says FUCK, the other ORF.)
    Gucci has set the location for its upcoming “Gucci Love Parade” fashion show. Los Angeles’ Hollywood Boulevard will
    be playing set to the show scheduled to take place on November 2.

    Gucci selected Los Angeles because they wanted to highlight the intersection of creativity and culture within the
    city and its rebirth post pandemic. As part of Gucci is Equilibrium program, the brand will provide support to Los
    Angeles and Hollywood communities through a donation to the city is homelessness and mental health programs.

    This year, Gucci is also marking its 100th anniversary. Gucci is parent company Kering recently posted Q3 results,
    and while the overall company saw growth, Gucci did fall short of expectations. The brand, along with Balenciaga,
    are considered the two biggest cash cows for Kering.

  <h1>Nordstrom and Nike partner with Black Owned Everything</h1>

  <p style="padding-left: 60px;"><img src="pic3.webp" class="right" width="750" height="650" />

  <p>Multibrand retailer Nordstrom has launched a
    partnership with marketplace Black Owned Everything, a platform
    promoting Black-owned businesses, and its founder Zerina Akers.
    The collaboration sees Akers and Nordstrom come together on a curated selection featuring four Black-owned brands,
    displayed alongside new Nike and Jordan collections in the Nordstrom x Nike dedicated online space.
    Labels included in the curation are William Okpo, Sammy B, LEnchanteur and handbag designer Brandon Blackwood.
    ''When we launched Black Owned Everything back in February of this year, partnerships like Nordstrom x Nike were
    exactly the type of activations I had in mind to amplify the reach of the Black designers whom I work with and
    mentor'' said Akers, in a release.
    She continued: ''This intersection of well-established brands and emerging designers is where the progress of Black
    Owned Everything is mission takes place.''
    The inclusion of these selected designers is a big step for their individual career paths and an even bigger step
    in the right direction for the American marketplace and beyond.
    Sportswear label Fila has unveiled a collaboration with birdwatching initiative Flock Together in the form of an
    apparel and footwear capsule, to be exclusively sold through LN-CC.

    In a range of hike-wear gear made for urban exploring, the collection intends to bring people into nature and engage
    with their community. The selection includes a reinvented version of the Fila Trailblazer hiking shoe and two
    shearling fleece designs.

    The colourways of the line are inspired by the Kingfisher bird, with a scannable near field communication (NFC) tag
    present in the hiking shoe that takes buyers to a dedicated page outlining the best places in the UK to spot a
    Kingfisher.
    15 percent of all sales of the collection will go towards the Flock Together community fund.

    Buying and creative director at LN-CC, Reece Crisp, expressed his enthusiasm over the collaboration in a release,
    stating: ''We are super excited for LN-CC to be part of this project.

    ''Flock Together encompasses everything that is great about community and wellness, two driving forces that are
    integral to LN-CC too.

    ''Flock Togethers growth has been both a reaction to, and antidote from, a difficult eighteen months by bringing
    people together and encouraging outdoor consciousness, so we are honoured to share our platform in amplifying its
    much-needed positivity while working with Fila in creating this tribute to the Kingfisher.''

    Flock Together, founded back in the 2020 covid-19 lockdowns, brings BIPOC together to engage in birdwatching and
    other nature-oriented activities.

    It has previously partnered on an event with Timberland, hosting a range of spoken word presentations at the nature
    reserve, Woodbury Wetlands. Sponsored by the apparel label, the event aimed to promote the voices in its growing
    community adjacent to guiding guests through the nature reserve.</p>
  <p style="padding-left: 50px;"><img src="pic5.webp" alt="" class="center" width="500" height="650" /></p>

  <p>''This curation is a fun mix of fashion and lifestyle pieces for the people who are keen to street trends and enjoy
    functionality.''
    Simultaneous with the online presence of the collection, Black Owned Everything merchandise will also be available
    at four Nordstrom x Nike pop-ups in US-based Nordstrom stores.</p>
