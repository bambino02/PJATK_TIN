            behaviors in their sleep that resemble what they do in a fully awake state. Paddling legs, whining, growling, wagging tails, chewing jowls, and twitching noses inspire us to wonder what our dogs are dreaming about. <br>
            <h2>What do we know about COVID-19 and Pets?</h2>
            <p>People continue to ask and I am repeating the info as not everyone sees everything posted. Dr. Gail Golab of the American Veterinary Medical Association in conjunction with the CDC answer your most common questions regarding pets and COVID-19
                On my Steve Dales Pet World Listen HERE as Dr. Gail Golab, Chief Veterinary Officer, Scientific Affairs and Public Policy at the American Veterinary Medical Association explains what we do know and what we still may not be sure of regarding
                COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) and companion animals. Veterinarians deal with corona viruses a lot and have for a very long time, canine and feline corona viruses which the two species do not share with one another or share with people. Also, when
                we get the common cold it is usually a human corona virus (not to be confused with the novel corona virus which is now impacting the entire planet) and dogs and cats have never gotten colds from humans. But as Dr. Golab notes, this virus
                is different, and it is novel; we are still learning about it. There was a dog tested for the COVID-19 virus in Hong Kong, owned by someone who was suffering from COVID-19. The dog does have a low level of infection. But the dog has not
                become ill, and has not been able to spread the virus to other dogs or to people. (Important to note: any animal may carry and infection does not equate with infectious). Still, the AVMA and particularly local veterinarians will continue
                to follow this one Pomeranian in Hong Kong. IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. announced that the company has tested thousands of dogs and cats for the SARS-CoV-2 virus (COVID-19), and thus-far not a single positive test. These new test results
                align with the current expert understanding that COVID-19 is primarily transmitted person-to-person, and is now considered a human corona virus. IDEXX press release: IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (NASDAQ: IDXX), a global leader in veterinary
                diagnostics and software, today announced that the company has seen no positive results in pets to date of SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus strain responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) respiratory outbreak in humans. IDEXX
                evaluated thousands of canine and feline specimens during validation of a new veterinary test system for the COVID-19 virus. The specimens used for test development and validation were obtained from specimens submitted to IDEXX Reference
                Laboratories for PCR testing. These new test results align with the current expert understanding that COVID-19 is primarily transmitted person-to-person and supports the recommendation against testing pets for the COVID-19 virus. For dogs
                or cats presenting with respiratory signs, the recommendation is to contact a veterinarian to test for more common respiratory pathogens. ''Should leading health authorities determine it is clinically relevant to test pets for the COVID-19
                virus, IDEXX will be ready to make the IDEXX SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) RealPCR Test available,'' said Jay Mazelsky, President and Chief Executive Officer of IDEXX Laboratories. ''Pets are important members of our family, and we want to keep
                them healthy and safe. We will continue to monitor COVID-19 and pet health across our global IDEXX Reference Laboratories network as this situation evolves.'' IDEXX Reference Laboratories is a global network of more than 80 laboratories
                united by a shared commitment to advancing pet care. IDEXX never stops looking for new ways to do more and discover more to enhance the health and well-being of pets, people, and livestock. Customers worldwide benefit from the companies
                sophisticated network of veterinary reference laboratories in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, South Africa, Brazil, and across Europe, which offer the most complete and advanced menu of tests in the
                industry. Still, Dr. Golab says use common sense regarding interactions with dogs and cats. It makes sense to wash hands after handling any animal. If you are a positive for COVID-19, it probably makes sense to have someone else in the
                home care for the animal (if possible). Dr. Golab agrees with that in this time of great stress, hearing cats purr in our ears and taking walks with our dogs can help us to feel warm and fuzzier. The American Veterinary

            Medical Association has stayed on top on this fluid situation, and is arguably the most reliable resource. The AVMA and CDC do communicate with another. So many blogs and social media may be spreading misinformation Dr. Golab and the AVMA are arguably
            the most trusted in this time of confusion and fear. COVID-19 Spread on Surfaces, such as Pets? <img src="pic8.jpeg" style="height: 250px; width: 250px" class="left" alt="photo">Q: Can pets serve as fomites in the spread of COVID-19?
            A: Dr. Golab answers, ''sCOVID-19 is usually primarily transmitted when there is contact with an infected persons bodily secretions, such as saliva or mucus droplets in a cough or sneeze. COVID-19 might be able to be transmitted by touching
            a contaminated surface or object (i.e., a fomite) and then touching the mouth, nose, or possibly eyes, but this appears to be a secondary route. <q class="left">The dog </br>is a </br>gentleman</q> Smooth (non-porous) surfaces (e.g., countertops,
            door knobs) transmit viruses better than porous materials (e.g., paper money, pet fur), because porous, and especially fibrous, materials absorb and trap the pathogen (virus), making it harder to contract through simple touch. Because your
            pets hair is porous and also fibrous, it is very unlikely that you would contract COVID-19 by petting or playing with your pet. However, because animals can spread other diseases to people and people can also spread diseases to animals, it
            is always a good idea to wash your hands before and after interacting with animals; ensure your pet is kept well-groomed; and regularly clean your pets food and water bowls, bedding material, and toys.''</p>
            <h2>Should my pet be tested for COVID-19?</h2>
            <p>If your cat or dog is coughing, the good news is that it is probably not due to COVID-19. Experts from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) agree that COVID-19 is predominantly
                a human illness, and itis unlikely for pets to be infected with the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. There are many types of viruses that can make cats or dogs sick. So, your veterinarian will check your pet to make sure that the symptoms
                are not being caused by a more common virus or other health problem. Opinions about testing pets for COVID-19 are changing as we learn more about the virus and cases around the world. Public health authorities and veterinarians are working
                together to determine if an animal should be tested. Right now, there is no evidence that dogs or cats can spread the virus to people.
                <q class="left">Dogs do</br>speak,</br> but only</br> to those</br> who know </br>how to listen</q> But there is growing evidence that in rare cases people may be able to infect animals. In the past month, two dogs and a cat in Hong Kong,
                a cat in Belgium, and a tiger at the Bronx Zoo in New York City were found to have been infected. In each situation, there was exposure to a COVID-19 positive person. If your cat or dog is sick, the best thing to do is speak with your
                veterinarian. Be sure to let them know if your pet has been exposed to anyone who has COVID-19. Your veterinarian will let you know what to do and will work with public health authorities to determine if a test is recommended. For the
                most up-to-date information about COVID-19 and animals, please visit the CDCs website.

            <h2>How My Former Puppy Mill Dog Changed All of My Pet Health Assumptions</h2>
            <p>I am the first to admit that I tend to go a little overboard for my pets care. After all, as a life-long animal advocate, I have seen too much inhumanity, too much pain, too much suffering put on these animals not to want to reverse that in
                my own home. I have also seen how amazing, resilient and inspiring they can be. Even for me though, some treatments can seem too extreme for some pets. When I am faced with a serious medical decision, it can be difficult and stressful
                to decide what is right. Recently, I found myself in just such a situation with my dog, Fiona. I hope that my story might help you in the future.
            </p>
            <h3>Meet Fiona, former puppy mill breeder </h3>
            <p>Meet Fiona, perhaps the worst candidate for treatment (or so I thought). My little Fiona is an 11-year-old former puppy mill breeder who spent the first 7 years of her life in a cage, pumping out litters of (badly) purebred Italian Greyhounds.
                While her puppies were probably shipped to families across the country, she spent 7 years with little-to-no human interaction, affection or medical care. By the time she got to rescue she was so emotionally stunted that despite being smaller,
                younger and healthier than many other adoptable dogs in NYC she spent two years in foster care.
        </div>
        <div class="item4">
            She kept getting adopted and returned because she was so afraid to live like a normal dog. <q class="left">Every dog </br>must have </br>his day</q> I met Fiona shortly after her second anniversary with K9Kastle, a great rescue group I volunteered
            with at the time. I took Fi on as a foster to help with her socialization. I hoped I could work to get her to a place where she could bond with other people. Eventually, Fi and I got her there, but also ended up falling undeniably in love
            on the way. So I ''failed''' as a foster mom and became Fis permanent ''mom''' instead.

            <h3>Fionas fear of treatment</h3>
            <p>Two years later, Fis gone from the terrified pup who would duck for cover anytime someone moved, to approaching strangers on the street. (Thank you, bacon treats!!!) As she always did, she adores cuddles and chin scratches, but now seeks them
                out from people she does not know. She is even started doing a little post poop dance and run in the mornings. Fionas not without her scars. <q class="left">Everything </br>I know </br>learned</br>from
                    dogs</q> Recurrent urinary issues and frequent stress related colitis are two of the biggies. It took over a year to find a secondary caretaker who she had be comfortable with when I traveled to keep her from developing heartbreakingly
                bloody stools from the stress. She is never learned to play, but has found solace in stuffed kongs and rawhide chews. Medicating Fiona can set her off, so her veterinarians have often opted for the ''wait and watch'' approach when anything
                new comes up. It is not that they do not want to treat her; it is that treatment has often made the problem worse. So Fiona did not seem (to me) like the kind of pup who would be a good candidate for chemo. When we discovered a rare form
                of mast cell tumor in her gum I assumed treating it would mean destroying any quality of life she had left something I was not willing to do.</p>
            <h3>My decision to treat Fiona</h3>
            <p>I had never gone through chemo with my dogs or cats before. I had known others who had tried it, to varying results. However, I secretly always assumed that chemo would be a little extreme, even for me and especially for a dog like Fi. And,
                lucky or not, any time I had battled the big “C” with pets before, chemo was not a good option. But then Fis diagnosis came back and, yet again, she started teaching me to throw all of my assumptions to the wind. The cancer was inoperable,
                but slow growing A chemical released by the tumor was making her nauseated Chemo provided a small chance, but a bigger one than I had assumed She had to be medicated for the nausea and tumor side effects either way I was given a GREAT
                referral to an excellent oncologist, and had a quick crash course in mast cell tumors and chemo for dogs. The conversation was eye opening and soon, Fiona started chemo. </p>
            <h3>Fionas amazing reaction has changed all of my assumptions</h3>
            <p>Fionas now two weeks in and, amazingly, doing better than she has in months. Her poop dance is back. She begs me and my partner for pets. She comes running down the hall, ears perked, at ''wanna go for a walk?'' She has not started running
                away from me when it is time for her meds, yet. We wont know for a while whether the chemos actually doing anything, but for now, I am just thankful to have hope and yet another lesson from my ''little old lady.'' What is it they say?
                ''Never give up. Never surrender.'' Fionas got that one down.</p>
